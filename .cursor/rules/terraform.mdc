- Use OpenTofu as the tool instead of Terraform for all infrastructure as code tasks.
- Utilize OpenTofu workspaces to manage different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
- Store Terraform variable files (.tfvars) in the ./vars folder, organized by environment or purpose.
- Place all custom modules in the modules directory, ensuring they are reusable and well-documented.
