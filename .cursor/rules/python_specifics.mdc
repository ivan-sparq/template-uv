description: Python 3.11+ specific guidelines
---


- Use match-case statements for complex conditionals (Python 3.10+).
- Leverage tomllib for TOML parsing (Python 3.11+).
- Prefer Pydantic for data models over TypedDict when validation is needed.
- Use Pandera for defining schema for dataframes
- use list, dict, set, tuple, for type hints instead of the List and Dict from typing
- Avoid using 'Any' in type hints; be specific.
- For dependency management: Use 'uv add <package>' to add dependencies
